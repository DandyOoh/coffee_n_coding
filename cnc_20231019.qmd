# Referencing {background-image="images/scared_cat.gif"}

This approach works for me, but there'll likely be many other ways to skin the proverbial cat...

## Building a bibliography

-   text file in WD for storing all your references called e.g. references.bib (notepad++ or alternative)
-   standard [BibTex](https://bibtex.eu/types/) formatting for each entry (article, book, website etc...)
-   reference the bibliography file in your yaml header - "bibliography: references.bib"
-   call in-line in your report text using e.g. [@Beeley2023]

## example

::: {.fragment fragment-index="1"}
![](images/bib_entry_ex.png){.absolute top="100" left="0" width="1200"}
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index="2"}
![](images/ref_quarto_ex.png){.absolute bottom="50" left="0" width="700"}
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index="3"}
![](images/refs_final_ex.png){.absolute bottom="100" right="50" width="900"}
:::

## Reference 'styles'

-   Citation Style Language (CSL) determines the output type of your references. Harvard and Vancouver probably the most famous.

-   1,000's available to choose from, some specific to certain journals.

<https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles>

<https://www.zotero.org/styles>

-   save the style settings into css and reference in your yaml

# Report themes

What's your favourite Quarto theme?

Did you know there were built-in themes or themes other than Cosmo?

::: {.fragment fragment-index="1"}
```{=html}
<iframe width="1200" height="600" src="https://bootswatch.com/" title="Bootswatch website"></iframe>
```
:::

Of course if you have the time and ability you can build/define your own Strategy Unit theme <https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html>

# Layouts (document and chunks)

::: {.fragment .fade-out fragment-index="1"}
![](images/pulling_hair.png){.absolute top="100" left="0" width="700"}
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index="2"}
Default page/column widths are fine for portrait style reports/pdf. But when producing html reports that will 99% of time be viewed on monitors 4:3 or greater then too much blank real estate for my liking (and i'm not much of a fan of margin material!). So what to do with layout options?

-   Global versus chunk?

-   Tables, (leaflet) maps and images fit to global page settings...generated plots don't!

-   Plots default to png and weird things happen when you manually size them in chunks.

So....

## layout compromise

format:

html:

page-layout: full [(default nav panel on left then fills rest of screen with content)]{.fragment .highlight-red}

fig-width: 9 [(trial and error, seems to match page full width ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)]{.fragment .highlight-red}

fig-asp: 0.714 [(keeps quarto default plot ratio)]{.fragment .highlight-red}

fig-format: svg [(plot components don't go weird)]{.fragment .highlight-red}

<br />
